/*Problem 5: [10 points]
We are going to represent one player’s set of game pieces
a class name Team. It will contain an array
of Piece objects and a team color for the pieces.

Create a new class named Team with the following members:
- member field of type string for the color of the team
- member field to represent all Pieces that the belongs to the team 
    this should be of an array of Pieces (since they will have more than
    one type of Piece)
- constructor with two parameters: 
    (parameters should be in the order listed above) that sets the two member fields
- accessor methods 
    – getTeamColor and getTeamPieces
- mutator method 
    – removePieceFromTeam with a parameter Piece and no return value
    this method removes the Piece from the array
- mutator method 
    – addPieceToTeam with one parameter Piece and no return value
    this method should add the Piece to the Team and set the Piece’s 
    color to the team color.
- toString method with no parameters and returns a string
    with the team color and all of the team’s Pieces’ toString values
    For a team with color of ‘Red’ and four pieces, 
    the toString should look similar to this:
    Team Red Pieces : 
    Red M   Red B   Red S
