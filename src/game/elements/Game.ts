/*Problem 6: [10 points]
Create a new abstract class named Game. 
This class should have the following members:
- a member field for the GameBoard
- a member field for team A
- a member field for team B
- a member field (turn) that will hold the color of the team who’s turn it is
       this field will be changed after each player takes a turn
- a private method name initializeGameBoard that has no two parameters 
   and doesn't return a value. This method should
   set up both Team’s pieces randomly on the board
   Hint: use your findRandomEmptySquare method in your GameBoard class
   You should write your algorithm for this method before coding it!!

- constructor with the 4 parameters listed above -
    it should set these fields and call initializeGameBoard
    to set up the GameBoard with pieces on it

- acessor methods:
    - getGameBoard
    - getCurrentTeam - returns the Team (not just the color) 
             of the team whose turn it is 
    - getOpponentTeam - returns the Team (not just the color) 
          of the team whose turn it isn’t 
    - isTurn that has one Team parameter and returns a 
          boolean representing whether it is the Team’s turn    
- mutator method 
    – changeTurn – that sets the member field turn to switch to the other Team’s color
- abstract method
    - isGameEnded with no parameters and returns a boolean
- abstract method
    - getWinner with no parameters and returns a string

- toString mehod is already defined for you here:

 toString(): string {
        let retString: string = "";
        retString = retString.concat("Game Board:\n");
        retString = retString.concat("--------------");
        retString = retString.concat("\n" + this.getGameBoard().toString());
        retString = retString.concat(
            "\n" + this.getCurrentTeam().toString() + "\n",
        );
        retString = retString.concat(
            "\n" + this.getOpponentTeam().toString() + "\n",
        );
        retString = retString.concat(
            "\nIt is Team " +
                this.getCurrentTeam().getTeamColor() +
                "'s turn\n",
        );
        return retString.toString();
    }
